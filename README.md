# wiki-retrieval
"wiki-retrieval" is a document retrieval service that utilizes Wikipedia as its primary data source and is designed to be fully compatible with the OpenAI chatgpt-retrieval-plugin API. 

## Temporary Description
Welcome to the "wiki-retrieval" project, a powerful document retrieval service that leverages Wikipedia as its primary data source. This project is designed to be fully compatible with the OpenAI chatgpt-retrieval-plugin API, enabling seamless integration into your existing workflow.

One of the key features of "wiki-retrieval" is its ability to dynamically add documents in real-time based on user queries. This means that as users search for information, "wiki-retrieval" can automatically update its database with relevant articles from Wikipedia, ensuring that users always have access to the most up-to-date information.

To achieve this functionality, "wiki-retrieval" utilizes the popular Python web framework, Sanic. This lightweight and highly efficient framework is ideal for building high-performance, real-time web applications, making it the perfect choice for this project.

But that's just the beginning. In the future, we plan to add a wide range of additional features and capabilities to "wiki-retrieval", including:

Support for multiple languages: At present, "wiki-retrieval" is designed to work with English-language Wikipedia articles. However, we plan to expand its capabilities to include support for multiple languages, enabling users around the world to access the information they need.
Improved search functionality: While "wiki-retrieval" already offers powerful search capabilities, we're always looking for ways to improve. In the future, we plan to incorporate advanced search algorithms and techniques to make finding information even faster and more accurate.
Customization options: We understand that every organization has unique needs and requirements when it comes to document retrieval. That's why we plan to add a wide range of customization options, enabling users to tailor "wiki-retrieval" to their specific needs.
Integration with other services: Finally, we plan to integrate "wiki-retrieval" with a wide range of other services and platforms, making it even more powerful and versatile. Whether you're using chatbots, voice assistants, or any other type of AI-driven technology, "wiki-retrieval" will be the perfect complement.
